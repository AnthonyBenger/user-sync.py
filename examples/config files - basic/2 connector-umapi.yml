# This is a sample configuration file for the umapi connector type.
#
# umapi (user management api) is a network protocol served by Adobe that
# provides management of users in Adobe-hosted enterprise organizations.
#
# This sample file contains all of the settable options for this protocol.
# All of the settings here can be changed.  It is recommended
# that you make a copy of this file and edit that to match your configuration.
# While you are at it, you will likely want to remove a lot of this  commentary,
# in order to enhance the readability of your file.

# (optional) UMAPI server settings (defaults as shown)
# These settings specify how to contact the Adobe servers which
# host the UMAPI services and those which provide authorization.
# You will never need to alter these settings unless you are provided
# alternate values as part of a pilot program with Adobe.  It is
# highly recommended that you leave these values commented out
# so that the default values are guaranteed to be used.

# Adobe UMAPI documentation and the Adobe I/O Console to determine
# the correct settings for your enterprise organization.

# if relative, it is interpreted relative to this configuration file.]
