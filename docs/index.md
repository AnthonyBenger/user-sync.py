Welcome to the documentation center for User Sync, from Adobe.

# What is User Sync?

User Sync is a command-line tool that moves user and group
information from your organization's enterprise directory system
(such as an Active Directory or other LDAP system) to your
organization's directory in the Adobe Admin Console.

Each time you run User Sync, it looks for differences between the
user and group information in the two systems, and updates the
Adobe directory to match the information in your directory.

# Getting Started

The fastest way to get started with User Sync is to read the
[User Guide](user-guide/index.md), which both explains
the tool and gives guidance for setting up the needed
configuration files.
