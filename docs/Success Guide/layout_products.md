## Layout your Adobe products, PLCs, and user groups

User groups can be used to group users in a logical way that matches your understanding of how they are organized.

User groups can then be added to PLCs to grant licenses.

You create PLCs possibly with custom options for how you will use Adobe products.

User groups and PLCs can only be managed by one user sync instance.  If there are multiple directories or distributed departments feeding user information to Adobe via user sync, each must be matched to a single group or PLC.

Draw a diagram of your Adobe orgs, and the products and PLCs in each.  Add the directory or directory groups and show the mapping.
