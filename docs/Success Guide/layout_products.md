## Layout your Adobe products, PLCs, and user groups

Product License Configurations (PLCs) are group-like structures in the Adobe user management system.  Each PLC is associated with a product you have purchased.  Users added to a PLC are granted access to and get a license to use the corresponding product.  (The user does not receive anything in this process other than an optional notification that access has been granted.  All license management is handled by back-end systems).

You create PLCs with custom options that control how users will use Adobe products.

You can add users directly to PLCs to grans them access to products.  This is the most common way Adobe product licenses are managed.

Adobe User groups can be used to group users in a logical way that matches your understanding of how they are organized.  Their use is optional, however.  User groups can then be added to PLCs to grant licenses to users.


User groups and PLCs can only be managed by one user sync instance.  If there are multiple directories or distributed departments feeding user information to Adobe via user sync, each must be matched to a single group or PLC.

Create the PLCs in the Adobe Admin console for the configurations of products and groups of users you will be managing.

Draw a diagram of your Adobe orgs, and the products and PLCs in each.  Add the directory or directory groups and show the mapping.
